    <!-- What is css grid ?
    a grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical collection of lines, creating a pattern against which we can line up 
    or design element. they help us to creat layout in which our element wont jump around or change width as we move page to 
    page, provding greater consistency on our website.

    *layout is two dimensional
    *in row and column
    *we can make building complex layout strainghtforward.
    *a grid will typically have row and coloumn  and their gaps between each row and coloumn is called gutters. -->

    <!-- Grid and flexbox. The basic difference between CSS grid layout and CSS flexbox layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension 
    - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time. -->
