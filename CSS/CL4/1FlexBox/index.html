<!-- flexbox is great way of geeting more flexibility in your layout 
and to simplify responsive layout design. it makes it easy to align element 
on a 2d plan and is pretty easy to use once you get familier with the main property

1st step is to set display: flex on container element. the children to the flex container becomes flex items.
 -->

<!-- Flex container property 
*flex-direction = row , column, row reverse, coloumn reverse 
*flew-wrap = wrap, nowrap, rapreverse , by using this we can preserve the content from squezing 
*flew-flow = shorthand notation (flex flow: row wrap) 
*justify- content = flex start, flex-end, center, space-around, space-evenly, space-between. all the content will move with respect to main axis
*align - item = flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch, baseline, align the text with reference to cross axis
*align - content = flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space evenly. handles spacing between rows or column.
gap:10px this will make gap between boxes. -->


<!-- Flex item properties: The direct child element of a flex container automatically becomes flexible item.
*order= this will chsange the order of element by writing order:1, or any munber bigger number will go back and small no. will be at the front 
*Flex-Grow = flex-grow, we can grown the size (width) by witing flex-grow , for any specific row use order:1 flex-grow:1; box 1 will increase with increase speed.
*Flex-shrink= by using shrink we can decide which box will shrink at what speed by writing  
*Flex-basis = used to give width to container by writing flex-basis:100px. to flex items. the diffrence between flexbasis and width is that in width the text gets hidden but in flex basis it becomes responsiv and does not hide from the screen  
*Flex = shorthandnotation flex: 3 4 2 120px (above all 4 in one line)
*align-self = flex-end, flex-start, streach. this will align the box according to the command.
 -->

 <!-- box-sizing :border-box; = this will decrease the size of content but total size of the box remains same -->
